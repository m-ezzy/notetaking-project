# Introduction
- I wanted to learn a few frameworks, tools & technologies and I thought the best way to do that would be to create a simple note-taking application in all of them.
- This project is the result of that thought. It is a simple note-taking application that allows users to create, read, update and delete notes, so basic CRUD operations.
- It includes multiple servers and multiple clients written in different languages and frameworks, each with its own database and ORM.
- All the servers have the excat same endpoints, functionalities and all the clients have the exact same functionality, UI, UX. Therefore they all look and behave in exactly the same way.
- The clients connect to the servers via REST API. Any client will work in the same way with any server.
- Different technologies are used in different combinations to create the different apps.
